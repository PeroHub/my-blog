Implementing filtering functionality in an application is very common task of a developer to create a seemingly good user experience feature which saves a user the stress of scrolling through our website a bunch of time to find what they want.

In this tutorial, I assume that you have React knowledge already as this not a beginner tutorial.

To proceed, ensure that you have Node installed. Node is an open source JavaScript runtime environment that runs on chrome V8 engine. This comes bundled with NPM-- a package manager that would enable us install and run React.
